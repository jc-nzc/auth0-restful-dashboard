This repository contains a customized Auth0 dashboard implemented as a true RESTful system composed by an API (`auth0-restful-management-api` folder) and a React client (`auth0-restful-dashboard-client` folder).

The following articles describe the implementation details:

- [REST Architecture - Part 1: Building The API](https://auth0.com/blog/rest-architecture-part-1-building-api/)
- [REST Architecture - Part 2: Building the Client](https://auth0.com/blog/rest-architecture-part-2-building-client/)
